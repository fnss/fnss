    """
    Return a cyclostationary sequence of traffic matrices, where traffic 
    volumes evolve over time as sin waves.
    
    The sequence is generated by first generating a single matrix assigning 
    traffic volumes drawn from a lognormal distribution and assigned to 
    specific origin-destination pairs using the Ranking Metrics Heuristic
    method proposed by Nucci et al. [3]_. Then, all matrices of the sequence 
    are generated by adding zero-mean normal fluctuation in the traffic 
    volumes. Finally, traffic volumes are multiplied by a sin function with
    unitary mean to model periodic fluctuations.
    
    This process was originally proposed by [3]_.
    
    Cyclostationary sequences of traffic matrices are generally suitable for 
    modeling real network traffic over long periods, up to several days. In
    fact, real traffic exhibits diurnal patterns well modelled by 
    cyclostationary sequences.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    topology : topology
        The topology for which the traffic matrix is calculated. This topology
        can either be directed or undirected. If it is undirected, this 
        function assumes that all links are full-duplex.
    
    mean : float
        The mean volume of traffic among all origin-destination pairs
    
    stddev : float
        The standard deviation of volumes among all origin-destination pairs.
        
    gamma : float
        Parameter expressing relation between mean and standard deviation of
        traffic volumes of a specific flow over the time 
        
    log_psi : float
        Parameter expressing relation between mean and standard deviation of
        traffic volumes of a specific flow over the time    
    
    delta : float [0, 1]
        A parameter indicating the intensity of variation of traffic volumes
        over a period. Specifically, let x be the mean volume over a specific 
        OD pair, the minimum and maximum traffic volumes for that OD pair 
        (excluding random fluctuations) are respectively :math:`x*(1 - delta)`
        and :math:`x*(1 + delta)`
        
    n : int
        Number of traffic matrices per period. For example, if it is desired to
        model traffic varying cyclically over a 24 hour period, and n is set to
        24, therefore, the time interval between subsequent traffic matrices is
        is 1 hour.
    
    periods : int
        Number of periods. In total the sequence is composed of
        :math:`n * periods` traffic matrices.
    
    max_u : float, optional
        Represent the max link utilization. If specified, traffic volumes are
        scaled so that the most utilized link of the network has an utilization
        equal to max_u. If None, volumes are not scaled, but in this case links
        may end up with an utilization factor greater than 1.0
    
    origin_nodes : list, optional
        A list of all nodes which can be traffic sources. If not specified
        all nodes of the topology are traffic sources
    
    destination_nodes : list, optional
        A list of all nodes which can be traffic destinations. If not specified
        all nodes of the topology are traffic destinations

        the values of the nested dictionary are lists of nodes on the path
        from origin to destination (both included). For example, if the
        path from node 1 to node 4 is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, then 
        routing_matrix[1][4] = [1, 2, 3, 4].
        The networkx all_pairs_dijkstra_path function returns shortest paths
        in this format.
        If this parameter is None, then Dijkstra shortest paths are used.
