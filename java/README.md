# Fast Network Simulation Setup (FNSS) - Java library
The FNSS Java library can parse XML files of topologies, traffic matrices and event schedules generated through the core FNSS library. The parsed files are converted in Java objects that can be used in Java-based simulators.

## Project directory structure
The files of the Java FNSS library are organized in the following directories:

* bin: compiled class files (generated by the build script)
* dist: FNSS Java API built packages (generated by the build script)
* doc: Javadoc documentation (generated by the build script)
* examples: example code using the library
* lib: third-party libraries used by FNSS Java library
* src: source code
* test: test code

## Build
You can build the code or the documentation or run the tests by using the [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) build script (`build.xml`) provided in the root directory of the project.
To do so, after making sure you have Ant installed on your system, open a command shell, move to the root folder of the Java library (it is the one containing the `build.xml` file) and then type:

`ant`

By default, this script will compile the entire code, run unit tests, create Javadoc documentation and package the library into Jar files.
Generated Jar files will be saved in the `dist` directory.
Compiled Javadoc documentation will be saved in the `doc` directory. 

## How to use
To use the FNSS Java library, you need to add the FNSS Jar file to the classpath of your project.
The FNSS library is packaged in the file `fnss-java-api-VERSION.jar` which you can download from the FNSS website or you will find in the `dist` directory after building the library from source.
In addition to that, you need to add to your classpath also all the third-party libraries used by FNSS, which are listed under the requirements section of this README file.
For your convenience, we provided up-to-date Jar files of all FNSS dependencies in the `lib` directory.
We also included them in the files `fnss-java-api-VERSION-all.tar.gz` and `fnss-java-api-VERSION-all.zip` which you can download from the FNSS website or find in the `dist` directory after building FNSS.
After adding FNSS and all its dependencies to your classpath, you can start using FNSS by importing the package `uk.ac.ucl.ee.fnss` in your code.
To learn how to use the library, you can either look at the Javadoc documentation in the `doc` subdirectory or look at some examples provided in the `examples` subdirectory.
